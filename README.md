# ML From Scratch

**Status:** Day 0 – Setup & Planning  

This repository is intended to be a **hands-on learning project** where I implement basic Machine Learning algorithms **from scratch** in Python, without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The goal is to **understand the inner workings of ML algorithms** by building them manually.
